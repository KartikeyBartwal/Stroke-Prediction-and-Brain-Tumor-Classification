## Project Title: Healthcare AI for Stroke Prediction and Brain Tumor Detection

## Description:
This project aims to develop an AI-driven healthcare system for stroke prediction and brain tumor detection. It leverages machine learning models and deep learning techniques to analyze medical data and provide valuable insights to healthcare professionals.

## Features:

### Stroke Prediction: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurrence based on patient data such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, etc.
Brain Tumor Detection: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify brain MRI images and identify the presence of tumors.
Explainability: Integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LRP (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) techniques to provide interpretable explanations for model predictions.
Counterfactual Explanations: Implements Diverse Counterfactuals (Dice) to generate counterfactual explanations for model predictions, aiding in understanding the model's decision-making process.
Repository Structure:

### data: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
### models: Stores trained machine learning and deep learning models.
### notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and explanation techniques.
### src: Source code files including utility functions, data loaders, and model implementations.
### README.md: Instructions and information about the project, setup, usage, and contributions.
